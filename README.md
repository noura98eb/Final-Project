# Final-Project
Project for a JavaScript course 
The idea of this project is an approach to the library system, where it allows the user to log in, and it also provides an opportunity for people who own the username and password to enter the page where the books are available, and the user can insert, edit, delete and view books
For a more accurate description, this project can be considered as a description and presentation of information on an encyclopedia of books rather than just a library
Note: Images are only selected when adding or modifying a book from the assets file

As for the offers, under each slide there is a note explaining what is meant by the content (Arabic translation of the content)
